        <h3>2 Nephi 5:1-6</h3>
        Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my
        God, because of the anger of my brethren. 2 But behold, their anger did
        increase against me, insomuch that they did seek to take away my life. 3
        Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinks to
        rule over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now
        let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words.
        For behold, we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs unto
        us, who are the elder brethren, to rule over this people. 4 Now I do not
        write upon these plates all the words which they murmured against me.
        But it sufficeth me to say, that they did seek to take away my life. 5
        And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi, should
        depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those who would
        go with me. 6 Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my
        family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and
        his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my
        sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all those who would go
        with me were those who believed in the warnings and the revelations of
        God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words.

        <h3>Jacob 1:1-6</h3>
        1 For behold, it came to pass that fifty and five years had passed away
        from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob,
        a commandment concerning the small plates, upon which these things are
        engraven. 2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write
        upon these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most
        precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the
        history of this people which are called the people of Nephi. 3 For he
        said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other
        plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand them down unto
        my seed, from generation to generation. 4 And if there were preaching
        which was sacred, or revelation which was great, or prophesying, that I
        should engraven the heads of them upon these plates, and touch upon them
        as much as it were possible, for Christâ€™s sake, and for the sake of our
        people. 5 For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made
        manifest unto us concerning our people, what things should happen unto
        them. 6 And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much
        prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ and his kingdom, which should
        come.
